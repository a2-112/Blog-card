This is my solution to the Blog card challenge on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges is really an amazing site to better your tech skills by building realistic projects.

Overview
This project is yet again an interesting one,it layout and colors are beautiful and realistic. Beginning from the Html code, it was interesting as i made use of div tag, img tag, and p tag. The Css I used pseudo element to make a transition and transformation at a selected scale number and other selectors, the outcome was lovely.
